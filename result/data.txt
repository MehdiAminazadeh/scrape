The Dow Jones closed 100 points higher on Wednesday, marking its longest winning streak in nearly four years.

Investors continued to focus on corporate results, with Tesla, Netflix, IBM and United Airlines due to report quarterly results today after the closing bell. Among stocks, Verizon and AT&T shares jumped by 5.3% and 8.5% respectively, following lead-cable driven selloff.

Wheat futures in the US soared over 8% to over $7.2 per bushel on Wednesday as renewed geopolitical concerns extended the outlook on the barricade of Ukrainian exports. Russian forces attacked critical infrastructure in the Ukrainian port of Odesa, destroying key machinery and 60,000 tonnes of grain, shortly after announcing that any vessels approaching Ukrainian ports will be considered carriers of military cargo and attacked. The developments erased hopes that Russia could eventually resume the deal protecting seaborne grain exports out of Ukraine following its suspension this week, marking an end to the year-long scheme that linked wheat supply from one of the world's top producers just before this year’s harvest. Elsewhere, a renewed wave of dryness in key US growing regions hampered yield expectations on the ongoing harvest, driving markets to doubt the forecast of higher production from the USDA’s latest WASDE report.
Consumer price inflation in the United Kingdom dropped to 7.9 percent in June 2023, marking the lowest level since March 2022 and slightly below the market consensus of 8.2 percent, mainly due to a slump in fuel prices. Additionally, the core rate, which excludes volatile items such as energy and food, eased to 6.9 percent from May's 31-year high of 7.1 percent. Despite the recent slowdown, both rates remained well above the Bank of England's 2.0 percent target, providing the central bank with room to continue the ongoing policy tightening campaign. Transport prices declined 1.8 percent (vs 1.2 percent in May), driven by a 22.7 percent slump in the cost of fuels and lubricants. There were also notable downward effects from food and non-alcoholic beverages (17.3 percent vs 18.3 percent), furniture and household goods (6.5 percent vs 7.5 percent), and restaurants and hotels (9.5 percent vs 10.3 percent). On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.1 percent in June.
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) in the US fell by 20bps to 6.87% in the week ended July 14th, 2023, from 7.07% the week before which was the highest level since November. Meanwhile, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with jumbo loan balances (greater than $726,200) decreased to 6.89% from 7.04%. Treasury yields declined after a softer-than-expected inflation report for the US raised expectations the Fed will soon end its tightening campaign.  
The consumer price inflation rate in the Euro Area was confirmed at 5.5 percent in June 2023, the lowest level since January 2022, mainly due to a decline in energy prices. However, the core rate, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, picked up to 5.5 percent, above a preliminary estimate of 5.4%, remaining close to a recent peak of 5.7 percent and supporting the view that ECB policymakers are likely to continue raising rates in the upcoming months. Energy prices tumbled 5.6 percent (vs -1.8 percent in May), while prices rose at a softer pace for both food, alcohol & tobacco (11.6 percent vs 12.5 percent) and non-energy industrial goods (5.5 percent vs 5.8 percent). On the other hand, services inflation picked up to 5.4 percent from 5.0 percent. On a monthly basis, consumer prices advanced 0.3 percent in June.
South Africa's annual inflation rate eased further to a 19-month low of 5.4% in June 2023, down from 6.3% in May and below market forecasts of 5.6%, moving back to the central bank's target range of 3%-6%. Food inflation eased to an eleven month low of 11% (vs 11.8% in May) and prices also softened for household contents & services (4.6% vs 5.6%), clothing (3.2% vs 3.5%), transport (1.8% vs 7%) and restaurants & hotels (5.6% vs 6.4%). By contrast, inflation accelerated for housing & utilities (4.2% vs 4%), recreation & culture (4.1% vs 3.8%) and alcoholic beverages & tobacco (6.1% vs 5.9%). The annual core inflation, which excludes prices of food, non-alcoholic beverages, fuel and energy, slowed to 5% in June, after a 5.2% rise in May, and broadly in line with market estimates of 5.1%. On a monthly basis, consumer price inflation remained unchanged at 0.2%.
